 * MOVED TO API ENDPOINT
 * 
 * This file is kept for reference but the OpenAI client is now only used directly
 * in the API routes where it's safe to do so.
 * 
 * For client-side components, use the appropriate API endpoint instead:
 * - Form updates: /api/form-agent
 * 
 * Do not import this file in client components.
